# 42_push_swap
My version of Push_swap for the 42 School of programming.

A program that sorts a stack of integers in ascending order using only a set of predefined instructions.

You can only rotate or reverse rotate a stack, swap the first two elements of a single stack or push the first element of a stack to the other one.
